It seems like the account holder spends about the same amount each month, around $10,000. September had the lowest expenses with closer to $7,000.

The "income streams" section of the Plaid data seemed to not necessary include all of the account holders income, but we were able to pull this data directly from the Plaid API. It seems as though the last years income before taxes was $7285.
