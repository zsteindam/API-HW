We can see from the 100 simulations that the portfolio will grow immensely over the next thirty years. The starting blended portfolio price is around $220, and simluations have the price going as high as $3000.

![Confidence_Interval](\confidence_interval_mc.png)

The confidence interval chart shows that the most frequent outcome has the portfolio more than doubling with an ending price of around $500. There are some outliers, under $350, and over $1700. 

Given a $20,000 initial investment, the expected returns at varying percetiles are all very good. Even the 10th percetile has the portfolio up 84%.
